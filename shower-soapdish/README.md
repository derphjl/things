shower-soapdish 

~ sorry, all documentiton within the freecad file is in german only ~

this thing is... a soap dish. the rod in my shower has a 19mm diameter, so thats what i used. the diameter can be adjusted some, but eventually both halves of the clamp mechanism need to embiggen.

i used some m6 screws i have at hand, but that can also be adjusted easily.
