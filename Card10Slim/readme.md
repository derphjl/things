Frame for card10 badge
==========

This frame, intended to be 3D printed, is for use with card10 badge and 20mm watchbands. The Watchband interfaces with a pin of ~1,2mm in diameter.

This print is somewhat demanding, so good bed levelling, proper adhesion, a fine nozzle and a small layer height are advisable. 

Also, this will not work without good cooling as it includes overhangs of 45Â° (all buttons) and worse (the power button above the usb c port). I printed it on a prusa i3 MK3s with a .25mm nozzle at .1mm layer height and got good results.
Even at those fine settings, the print took just about half an hour for each side.

Note that there are 4 downfiring LEDs in the corners of harmonic Board which will be covered up by this frame. Printing with transparent or translucent filaments will turn this downside into a nice effect
